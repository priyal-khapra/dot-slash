# Motivation
A lot of times do we encounter such situations where we need asssitance for our day to chores like cleaning or laundry. But who would help us doing such basic stuff? We may have maids, but don't they charge an hefty amount? What if we say that we have made the perfect solution to this problem which is accessible, quick and affordable at the same time. And did we tell by booking a help from our website, you are also working for a social cause. It's a win-win.
With this website - perpetual pocket, we aim to provide employment opportunities to the vagabonds (those who belong below the poverty line). In this web application, we have two types of users: the first being the NGO’s(the provider of the services) and the rest being the usual consumers(of the services).

# Idea of the project
Here, we are trying to aid and empower that corner of our society, who are unemployed and needy. Every human, with the course of time, learns a basic skill. We here at Goal Diggers are trying to make that one skill, earn them substantial money. NGO’s can easily approach such people, and by registering themselves with us, we can create monetary opportunities for the needy ones. NGO’s will upload the picture and relevant skillset of the person on their profile which will be saved in our database. We on our portal have a fixed and affordable price for each service, reducing any chance of deceiving and fraudulence. Now, the consumers who require a particular service can register/log in on our website. They can then book a service and time. We in turn connect the consumer to the appropriate NGO who will thereby appoint the apt person for the job. The person is then sent to the location and rightfully does the task and earns some cash.
